Please find all changes made in js/app.js

Compared to project 4 this was so tiny

I hope it really was meant this way

You can see the game running here

https://frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-jmfrank63.c9.io/index.html

How to use the game:

If using locally click index.html to start the game. If run on
the internet navigate to:
https://frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-jmfrank63.c9.io/index.html
The game is more a case study than a actual game. There isn't
very much you can do: Once started use the cursor keys to move your
buddy around. Do not move into the water, otherwise you will be set back
to your starting position. Avoid the bugs. Hitting a bug,
or getting hit by one resets you to your starting position as well.
As a challenge (the only one that is currently around)
you can try to stay on the street as long as possible.

Sorry:

I would like to applogize for being so sloppy. The code
has been restyled using eslint. Trailing spaces have
been removed infix operators sourrounded by white spaces.
Semicolons have been added or removed where appropriate.

Not doing this meant extra work for you and I admit this
would have been unnecessary.

Final remarks:
The game engine is starting to attract my interest.
I hope I will be able to use it, although I will
modify it for my needs. The basic idea is to
use the engine and make a python wsgi api for a
quick and easy browser gui. To be specific I am
currently trying to recreate simplegui as
it is used in http://www.codeskulptor.org
I am using this as a learning project as I thought
one person might be able to accomplish within a couple
month wiht a few hours a week.
The advantage shall be to have a full fledged python
instead of a javascript python implementation.
