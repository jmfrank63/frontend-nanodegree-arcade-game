Compared to project 4 this was so tiny

I hope it really was meant this way

You can see the game running here

How to use the game:

The game is more a case study than a actual game. There isn't
very much you can do: Use the cursor keys to move around your
buddy. Do not move into the water, otherwise you will be set back
to your starting position. Avoid the bugs. Hitting a bug,
or getting hit by one resets you to your starting position.
As a challenge (the only one that is currently around)
you can try to stay on the street as long as possible.

Sorry:

I would like to applogize for being so sloppy. The code
has been restyled using eslint. Trailing spaces have
been removed infix operators sourrounded by white spaces.
Semicolons have been added or removed where appropriate.

Not doing this meant extra work for you and I admit this
would have been unnecessary.
